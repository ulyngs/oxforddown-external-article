library(tidyverse)

cat_data <- read_csv(here::here(params$other_path, "data", "cats.csv"))
```

## Introduction
Many people think that there is a relationship between a cat's height and how much salt it consumes.
  
## Methods
```{r, out.width=params$out_width, fig.cap="A very funny cat"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here(params$other_path, "figures", "cat.jpg"))
```

This cat came up with all of the methods for this paper.


## Results
```{r, fig.cap="Cat height by cat salt eating"}
cat_data %>% 
  ggplot() +
    geom_point(aes(cat_height, cat_salt_eating)) +
    labs(x = "Cat height", y = "Daily amount of salt consumed")
```

## Discussion
There's some uncertainty in our data, but we've clearly got a cat-salt problem here.

## Conclusion
This changes everything.
